In beginning of any application, it starts in following way:

##### Simple System
Just write 1 integration of Application and Datasource.
##### Complicated System
16 integrations for different datasources for different applications. Becomes very complicated and coupled as we scale.

###### Difficulties comes with each integration
- **Protocol:** how the data is transported such as TCP, HTTP, REST, FTP etc
- **Data format:** how the data is parsed such as _Binary, CSV, JSON, Avro, Protobuf_ etc.
- **Data scehma & evolution:** how the data is shaped and may change
- **Increased Load:** As userbase increase, load also increase on systems.

## Solution - Apache Kafka
![[Attachments/Pasted image 20250308070457.png|right|650]]
- Kafka was created by **LinkedIn**.
- It is open source mainly maintained by **Confluence**, **IBM**, **CloudEra**, **LinkedIN** etc.
- Distributed, Resillient and Fault Torent Architecture
- Horizontally Scalable:
	- can scale upto 100s of brokers
	- can scale upto millions of messages
- High performance and Near Realtime Latency ~10ms.
#### Applications
- Messaging System / Queue.
- Microservices Pub / Sub.
- Acitivity Tracking
- Gathering Metrics for different locations
- Application Logs Gathering
- Streams Processing
- Decoupling System dependencies
- Integrations with Big Data Technologies such as _Spark, Hadoop, Flink, Storm_ etc.
###### Example
- **Netflix** uses *Kafka* to apply recommendations in real-time while you're watching TV shows
- **Uber** uses *Kafka* to gather user, taxi and trip data in real-time to compute and forecast demand, and compute surge pricing in real-time
- **LinkedIn** uses *Kafka* to prevent spam, collect user interactions to make better connection recommendations in real time.

> In every usecase, ***Kafka*** is used as transportation mechanism.
