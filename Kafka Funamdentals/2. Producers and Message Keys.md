# Producers
- Producers write data to topic's partitions.
- They know in advance to which _Partition_ they need to write to, and which _Broker_ has it.
- In case, **Kafka Broker** has _partition failure_, producers are smart enough to automatically recover messages.
- Producers send data to partitions based on some mechanisims (a reason behind scalabiltiy of Kafka).
#### Message Keys
- Producers can choose to send an optional **Key** *(string, number, binary etc.)* along with message.

> Key === `null`
> Data will be sent to partitions in **Round Robin Manner** and the load will be balanced across partitions.

> Key !== `null`
> All messages sharing same key will always go the same partitions. Thanks to ***Hashing***. Thus, all messages with same key will be received in order by consumer.

##### How **Kafka Messages** look ?
This message goes into Apache Kafka for storage.

##### How these messages are created ?
**Kafka** accepts only series of bytes as input from *Producers* and give series of bytes as output to *Consumers*. But when we construct messages, they obviously are not always just bytes.
#### Kafka Message Serializer
***Message Serialization:*** The process of transforming objects / data into bytes. It is done on *Keys* and *Values*. The messages are sent into **Kafka** after this process.

**Kafka Producers** come with common serializers:-
- String  Serializer
- Int / Float Serializer
- Avro Serializer
- Protobuf Serializer
## Message Hashing
![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250308165110.png|center]]
- **Kafka Partitioner** is a code logic that takes a record and determine in which partition it must be sent to.
- **Key Hasing** is process of determining the mapping of *Key* <==> *Partition*.

> ***In default Kafka Partitioner, the keys are hashed using Murmur2 Algorithm***.

```js
targetPartition = Math.abs (Utils.murmur2(keyBytes)) % (numPartitions - 1);
```
