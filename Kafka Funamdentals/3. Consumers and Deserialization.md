# Consumers
- Consumers in Kafka implement the **PULL** model. They will request data from *Kafka brokers* and get response back.
- Consumers automatically know which broker to read from. In case of broker failures, they know how to recover.
- Data from within each partition will be read from *Low to High* offset in order. Order across partitions is not guranteed.

#### Consumer Deserializer
As we know, Kafka only takes series of bytes as input, and give series of bytes as output. So, consumer need to transform these bytes into objects / data known as **Deserialization**.
- This deserialization happens on *Key* and *Value*.
- Consumer need to know the format of data in advance.
Common deserializers are bundled with **Apache Kafka**:
1. String (inc. JSON)
2. Int / Float
3. Avro
4. Protobuf

**NOTE:** The *Serialization & Deserialization* type must not change during a topic lifecycle. To do so, we can just create a new topic.
## Consumer Groups 
As our application scales, the number of consumers keep on increasing. So, consumers usually read data from the topic in groups.
- Each consumer within the group will be going to read data from exclusive partitions.
- Thus, a consumer group read the topic as a whole.

In a ***Consumer Group*** requesting data from a **Topic**:

###### If *No. of Partitions* < *No. of Consumers*
>![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250314184035.png|600]]
Some consumers may be inactive and don't consumer any data,
###### If *No. of Partitions* = *No. of Consumers*
> ![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250314184100.png|600]]
Each consumer will consume data from 1 distinct partition.

###### If *No. of Partitions* > *No. of Consumers*
 
>![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250314183541.png|600]]
Each consumer may consume data from multiple distinct partitions.
##### We can have multiple *Consumer Groups* on same ***Topic*** as well. For example: 
 In trucks example, there were *Location* and *Notification* services consuming same *truck_gps* topic. So, they will act as two consumer groups.
> ![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250314184624.png|1000]]***To create distint consumer groups, we can use property of consumer named `group.id`. Whenever a consumer joins a group, rebalancing of group happens to divide partitions among consumers.*** 
#### Consumer Offsets
![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250314190328.png|right|800]]
- These consumer groups are even more powerful. In a group, we can define **Consumer Offsets**.
- Kafka stores the *offsets* at which a consumer group has been reading in an internal topic named - `__consumer_offsets`.
- Consumers in the group commit these offsets periodically. This allows the consumer to keep on reading from that offset onwards.
- When a consumer commits the offset, the **Kafka Broker** will write it to the `__consumer_offsets`, not the group itself.
- Offsets represents how far the consumer has processed the data successfully. If a consumer dies, it will be able to read back from offset in that partition from where it left.
##### Delivery Semantics for consumers
By default, Java consumers will automaticallt commit offsets ***at least once***. There are 3 delivery semantics if commit manually:
1. **Atleast Once:**
	- Offsets are committed right after message is processed
	- If processing goes wrong, message will be read again. 
	- So, they can be duplicate processing of same message, So, the processing must be *Idempotent* (processing again shouldn't impact the system).
	- Usually preferred
2. **Atmost Once**
	- Offsets are committed as soon as message is received.
	- If processing goes wrong, message will be lost and never read again.
3. **Exactly Once**
	- If we want to process the message exactly once, no matter it will be processed successfully or will be failed.
	- *Kafka* <----> *Kafka* workflows - Read from one topic and write to another topic. We can use Transactional API (easy with *Kafka Streams* API)
	- *Kafka* <-----> *External* workflows - Use an *Idempotent Consumer*.
