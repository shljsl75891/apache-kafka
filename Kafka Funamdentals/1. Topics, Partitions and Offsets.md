# Topics
 - It represents a particular stream of data within a *Kafka Cluster.*
 - The sequence of messages is called **Data Streams**.
 - It accepts any kind of message format such _JSON, Avro, Binary_ etc.
 - It is just like a SQL Table without any constraints.
 - We can't query the **Topics** like tables. *Producers* write data into them, and *Consumers* read data from them
### Partitions and Offset
![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250308113337.png|left|650]]
- **Topics** can split into as many number of **Partitions** as we want.
- We will study later how many number of partitions should we keep according to usecase.
- Messages within a partition will be ordered.
 - They are immutable. Once data is written to a partition, it cannot be changed.
- Each message in partition is assigned an incremental ID. This ID is called **Offset**.

#### Example - Kafka Topic with 10 (aribitrary) partitions
```json
{
	"truckId": 9832,
	"coordinates": {
		"latitude": 37.7749,
		"longitude": -122.4194
	}
}
```

#### Important Points to remember
- Data is kept for limited amount of configurable time. *(Default = 1 Week)*
- Each partition has its own incremental offsets.
- Offsets kept on increasing even if some messages have been deleted.
- Order is guranteed only within a partition only across partitions.

> ***Data is assigned randomly to partitions unless a key is provided.***
